Another funny idea is the idea of  up  Is  up  an absolute concept 
It was in Aristotelian physics Only in Newtonian physics was it realised
that up is a local concept that one person  up  can be another person
down  if the rst is in Cambridge and the second is in Australia say
Einstein discovery of relativity depended on a similar realization about
the nature of time that one person  time can be another person  sideways
Well let's get back to basics I'd like to take you through some simple
ideas relating to squares to triangles and to knots
